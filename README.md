This game was a group project. I worked with Grace Perry and Gabriel Farley to make this game using processing.

Check out the [GITHUB REPOSITORY](https://eggz-csm.github.io/LET_LOOSE).

I personally made the majority of graphics as well as all of the sound effects and the implementation of them.
I also created a "MusicManage" class that worked to make adaptive music. When in range of an enemy, the music will smoothly transition to a more intense version of the background music. (I also made this music myself)
